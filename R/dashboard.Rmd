# Overall data {.tabset}

## By actual date

Minnesota reports many COVID-19 metrics based on the date the event actually occurred — the date a test was taken, a person was admitted to the hospital, or died. This data takes some time to stabilize — up to a week for cases, and several weeks for deaths. Below is actual-date data for Minnesota as of `r format(current_report_date - 7, "%B %d, %Y")` — except for deaths, which are as of `r format(current_report_date - 21, "%B %d")`:

```{r table_actual_date}
list(covid_data_actual %>%
	 	filter(cases_complete == TRUE) %>%
	 	filter(date == max(date)) %>%
	 	select(new_cases, new_hosp) %>%

	 	pivot_longer(everything(), values_to = "New"),
	 covid_trends_actual %>%

	 covid_trends_actual %>%

### Daily data

Below is a table showing Minnesota's COVID-19 data by actual date. Numbers in <span style="color: red;">red</span> reflect incomplete data and may rise as more data comes in.

```{r}

	arrange(desc(date)) %>%
	transmute(date, day, new_cases, 
			  # new_tests, positivity, 
			  new_hosp, new_icu, new_nonicu, new_deaths, cases_complete, deaths_complete) %>%
	# mutate(positivity = percent(positivity, accuracy = .01)) %>%
	mutate(across(is.numeric, comma, accuracy = 1)) %>%
	mutate(across(new_cases:new_nonicu, ~cell_spec(., color = case_when(cases_complete == FALSE ~ "red", TRUE ~ "black")))) %>%
